# Vynix Branching Conversation Guide

## Overview
Vynix now supports a powerful branching conversation system that allows you to create detailed, hierarchical discussions by selecting specific text from AI responses and creating new branches to elaborate on those topics.

## How to Use Branching

### 1. Start a Conversation
- Create a new conversation with an initial prompt
- The AI will generate a response

### 2. Select Text for Branching
- **Click and drag** to select any text from an AI response
- The selected text will be highlighted
- An "Elaborate" button will appear

### 3. Create a Branch
- Click the **"Elaborate"** button that appears
- The system will automatically create a new branch with a contextual prompt
- The AI will generate a response that elaborates on your selected text

### 4. Continue Branching
- You can create multiple branches from the same response
- Each branch can have its own sub-branches
- This creates a tree-like structure similar to a mind map

## Visual Features

### Branch Indicators
- Nodes created from selected text show a "Branch from:" indicator
- The original selected text is displayed for context
- Branch connections are shown with dashed blue lines

### Tree Layout
- Parent nodes are positioned to the left
- Child nodes are positioned to the right
- Siblings are stacked vertically
- The layout automatically adjusts as you add more branches

### Selection Feedback
- Selected text is highlighted in real-time
- A preview shows what text will be used for branching
- The "Elaborate" button appears with a tooltip showing the selected text

## Use Cases

### Learning and Research
- Start with a broad topic
- Select specific concepts you want to explore further
- Create branches for each subtopic
- Build a comprehensive understanding

### Problem Solving
- Begin with a problem statement
- Select different aspects of the problem
- Create branches to explore each aspect in detail
- Develop a complete solution

### Content Creation
- Start with a main idea
- Select specific points to expand upon
- Create branches for each supporting point
- Build a detailed outline or article

## Tips for Effective Branching

1. **Be Specific**: Select precise text that represents a single concept or idea
2. **Use Context**: The system includes the parent conversation context for better responses
3. **Explore Deeply**: Don't hesitate to create multiple levels of branches
4. **Stay Organized**: The tree structure helps you keep track of your exploration

## Technical Details

- Branches maintain conversation context from parent nodes
- Selected text is preserved and displayed for reference
- The AI receives enhanced prompts that include the selected text context
- All branches are saved and can be revisited later
- The tree structure is automatically laid out for optimal viewing

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter**: Create a new conversation (when no conversation exists)
- **Enter**: Create a branch (when a node is selected and prompt is entered)
- **Escape**: Clear text selection

The branching system transforms your conversations into dynamic, explorable knowledge trees that help you dive deep into any topic!
